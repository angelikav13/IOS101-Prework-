## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Applications: 
- Apple Music:
    - Lyrics are aligned with the song playing (almost like karaoke)
    - Able to see my listening history 
    - Able to see what my friends are listening to in the real time 
- Spotify: 
    - Great algorithm for music recommendations 
    - Holds not only official versions of songs, but remixes, slowed versions, etc
    - Spotify Wrap at the end of the year 
- TikTok:
    - In app shopping regardless of it being a social media 
    - Reposts (your friends can see what you watched without actually sending it) 
    - Work with Artists feature to help grow music industry and get compensated 

## Notes
The App I want to build: A "planner" app specifically for students. It would have a calendar, Todo list, deadlines, notifications, notes. Students would be able to upload their school work directly from educational platforms like Canvas and it would automatically create deadlines, reminders of policy, events (such as exams and quizzes). Implement a chat with other users in order to get help from other students, or even be able to "buy" tutoring from others through the app. Basically a huge platform that would have everything a student needs. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had a 16.3 version of XCode which had a different interface than the 16.2 (which the directions were aimed at). There was no "Interface" or "Language" options while creating a new app. I had to download a 16.2 version in order to be able to follow the directions directly from Code Path. Also struggled with connecting the buttons with their "actions".
